    /*
     For the moment this training calculator only works with 1 training programm. It works on 5 days :
     1 : abs, 2 : arms, 3 : abs, 4 : arms, 5 : rest
    
     If we sum up it means that on 5 days you should do 2 arms, 2 abs and 1 rep.
     
     To recommend a workout, the programm will look at the past 5 days that will maybe give :
     abs, arms, rest, abs
     You need to do 2 arms per 5 days and the programm see that only one has been done so it recommend you to do arms today.
     
     This is basically how the recomendation work. There are a lots of little tweaks that were not explained here but it is still the main principle.
